    Welcome to the Entry Exam Walkthrough! We've created this guide to help you prepare for your upcoming exam. The practice questions here are similar to what you'll encounter in the actual test.

    Our goal isn't to keep the exam questions secret—instead, we want to help you understand the core concepts that each question tests. We recommend reviewing this walkthrough before starting your exam.
